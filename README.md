# Real Life Churn Prediction with PySpark

## Packages
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - PySpark
  - PySpark ML
  - PySpark SQL
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn


## Motivation

The project motivation stems from the saving our beloved company Sparkify. Sparkify is a music streaming platform that has high customer churn rate around 23%.
Our goal is to predict the customers who are intend to churn and giving them options and maybe discounts make them stay with our platform. In order to do that we examine
the previous customer's behavours. We used some EDA technics to explore our data and did some feature engineering to get our training dataset ready.
Later we used different machine learning algorithms since this is a binary classification problem, churn/not churn, we used classifiers to solve the problem. We used hyperparameter tuning technics and reported our findings. 

## File Description

All the code regarding the solution included in one jupyter notebook, Sparkify.ipynb. The codes are cleaned and written clearly.

## Medium

I also published a [medium article](https://medium.com/@cihan.evren/real-life-churn-prediction-with-pyspark-98791d0a66dd) to report findings and give a walk through for the code. The classification algorithms explained clearly and performance metrics are provided within
the report.

## Thanks

I would like to thank the udacity team to propose this amazing problem as well as the very well documented [pyspark](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd025/parts/cd2242/lessons/cfc8e318-d16f-48e4-a7dc-5589feba3dfc/concepts/ffbbdea0-606c-40c3-b9ba-a02f6339104a) course.
I also want to thank [sparkbyexamples](https://sparkbyexamples.com/) team for contributing so much to the pyspark community.
